<p>Town Mayor Christian Estrosi had fought a bitter legal battle with the French state in an attempt to stop\xa0it opening, claiming the owner, Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs Sheikh Saleh bin Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh (pictured left) \u201cadvocates Sharia law and destroyed all the churches on the Arabian Peninsula.\u201d</p>,
 <p>\u201cOur intelligence agencies are worried about this place of worship,\u201d the mayor said, before warned about \u201cunregulated foreign funding,\u201d <a href="/web/20160715155523/http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/nice-christian-estrosi-attaque-en-justice-le-prefet-des-alpes-maritimes-au-sujet-d-une-mosquee-7782985664">according</a> to French news site RTL.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Estrosi, mayor since 2008, argued that the project, which was initiated under his predecessor in 2002, was unauthorised. He took central government representative Prefect Adolphe Colrat to court but did not succeed.</p>,
 <p>Mr. Colrat accused Mr. Estrosi, who is a member of France\u2019s centre-right The Republicans Party, of \u201cfeeding populism\u201d and scapegoating the entire Muslim community to gain votes, AFP reported.</p>,

 <p>The mosque opened at the beginning of this month, and was described as \u201ca real joy\u201d by Ouassini Mebarek, a lawyer and head of a local religious association.</p>,
 <p>\u201cBut there is no smug triumphalism,\u201d he <a href="/web/20160715155523/https://www.yahoo.com/news/saudi-funded-mosque-opens-nice-long-struggle-205833474.html">told</a> AFP. \u201cThis is recognition of the law, and a right to freely practise one\u2019s religion in France in accordance with the values of French Republic\u201d.</p>,
 <p>Cleric Saleh bin Abdul-Aziz Al ash-Sheikh is <a href="/web/20160715155523/http://www.islamdaily.org/Media/Documents/091903_henderson.pdf">perceived</a> to be a strict adherent of Wahhabism \u2013 the dominant strain of Islam in Saudi Arabi and the state religion \u2013 which has been described, variously, as \u201cultraconservative\u201d, \u201caustere\u201d, \u201cfundamentalist\u201d and even \u201cextremist\u201d.</p>,
 <p>The revivalist movement is closely related to the Salafism practices by Islamic State (IS) terrorists, with the two terms \u2013 Salafi and Wahhabi \u2013 often considered synonymous and interchangeable.</p>,
 <p>Last night, at least 84 people died in the city, including children, after a lorry slammed through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, France\u2019s national day.</p>,
 <p>Identification papers found in the truck point to a 31-year-old Nice resident that held duel French and Tunisian citizenship. French President Fran\xe7ois Hollande declared it an \u201cundeniable\u201d terrorist attack.</p>]
